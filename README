Overview
--------------------

Scalafy is a library written in Scala that provides some additional utility
classes and functions for things such as CSV parsing, string casing
conversion, etc. It also contains experimental code for handling type erasure
using a set of reifiable types and special extractors.

The scalafy code depends only on the core Scala API and the core Java 2
Standard Edition API. Scalafy is released under the EPL 1.0 open source
licence. A copy of the license can be found in this directory.
